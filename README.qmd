`canape` is a lightweight software to read, process, and analyze `.gpx` data from [Strava](https://strava.com).
The `Ride` class allows to read a file and converts it to a `pandas` data frame.


Importing the `Ride` class allows to read from Strave `*.gpx` files:

```{python}
from canape import Ride

ride = Ride("data/After_Riccione.gpx")
ride.data[['ele', 'time', 'power', 'lon', 'lat', 'speed']].head()
```

Helper functions allows to show a summary of relevant statistics like the normalized power, average speed, or climbed meters:

```{python}
ride.summary
```

Setting an FTP automatically calculates further statistics such as the intensity factor or stress level:

```{python}
ride.setFTP(250)
ride.summary
```

Plotting is done with plotly as backend:

```{python}
#| eval: false
ride.plotData('power').show()
```
